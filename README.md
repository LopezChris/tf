## Get started

Ensure that the environment you are using has venv with:

- **python3**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **tf-hub**
- **tensorflow**

Have dependencies installed preferably in a virtual environment

~~~bash
pip3 install virtualenv
~~~

Make and activate your environment

~~~bash
mkdir ~/venvtf
virtualenv ~/venvtf
~~~

Source and activate

~~~bash
source ~/venvtf/bin/activate
~~~

Now for the good stuff

~~~bash
brew install python3
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tensorflow-hub
~~~
